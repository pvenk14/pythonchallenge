Pyber Observable Trends

The general observable trend is that, the number of drivers seems to increase with city classification with rural areas having the least amount of drivers per city and urban areas having more. However, there are urban areas that have similar number of drivers. Perhaps a study of population or geographic size versus number of drivers would be beneficial in exploring this trend.

It can be observed from the Bubble plot that the relationship between rides and Avg fare is not consistent. The data for Suburban and Urban types is more well defined. This could be due to the fact that drivers are more in numbers in the Urban and Suburban areas. This could be the reason for the Average fare in Urban areas not going above 30$. From the pie chart it can be inferred that, most of the revenue is generated by trips in Urban and Suburban areas. 

In addition to this, when looking at the pie charts, it can be inferred that 80% of Urban drivers contribute to over 60% of the total revenue and rides generated. While the Avg fare for the drivers in the Urban areas is not much, it can be seen that few drivers in Rural areas seem to get higher fares with lesser number of rides. While the number of rides in Rural areas is less, the avg fare is higher. More information about frequency of rides per day would help determine accurate data related to wages earned by drivers.

```python
# Take in all of our wrestling data and read it into pandas
ride_df = pd.read_csv("raw_data/ride_data.csv")

```python
